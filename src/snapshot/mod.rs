        // in-place open MINTS `-wal` and `-shm` beside the user's file and a
        // read-only connection cannot clean them up on close. Measured — two
        // files left behind, on a command whose whole job is to look. Staging
        // also preserves the semantics this arm has always had: `fs::copy` takes
        // the main database file and not its `-wal`, so `inspect` reports the
        // last checkpointed state and never disturbs a live index.
        //

        // `VACUUM INTO`, and its output is `journal_mode = delete` (measured on
        // a real `create --out`), so every artifact this tool produces takes the
        // in-place arm. What reaches the staging arm is someone pointing
        // `inspect` at a live `.code-graph/index.db` — which is not a snapshot
        // and is refused below. Refused by the `schema_version == 0` verdict, to

        // table, it just holds no `snapshot_*` rows. An earlier version of this
